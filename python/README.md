# Python implementation of the Logger
In this folder you will find a Python implementation of the speedtest logger. It is meant to be reference code for the `Return of the Logger` step in 
the workshop. 

The code has example values for the user and API URL to post to, which you should replace with your own values before use.
To run, you need to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` and then run `python main.py`.
